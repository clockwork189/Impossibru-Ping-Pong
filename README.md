As the name states, this is an impossible to beat ping pong game.

The game of ping pong actually has a bigger value for me than can be expected. This is mainly because my first program ever written was Ping Pong. I had just learnt to code and our class assignment was to build the game of ping pong. 

Those were the days when programming just pieced together in my head with little to no effort. I felt like I had a deeper understanding of programs even though I just learnt it.

Needless to say, my game ruled and it is actually up in another one of my repos. You will see the code in it is very primitive and I have accomoplished everything that I did with that code, in this one much faster and more efficiently.
